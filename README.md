# Internship-Projects-Data-Analytics-using-Python<br>
I have started an Internship program for 2 weeks which was an online internship. <br>
Project's of Data Analytics using Python Domain were given as a task in this internship. <br>
This Data Analytics using Python domain has in total 2 projects, namely:  <br>
1> **Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data**<br>
“Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming” following is the Hypothesis for the analysis.
The Hypothesis means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So you are basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period.<br>

2> **Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn.** <br>
In this blog we are going to recognize Handwritten single digits(0–9) correctly using the digits data set from Scikit-Learn, which is a Python Library that contains numerous useful algorithms that can easily be implemented and altered for the purpose of classification and other machine learning tasks, and by using a classifier called Logistic Regression. We are going to train a Support Vector Machine and then we will be predicting the values of a few unknown Handwritten digits.<br>
Digits data set consists of 1,797 images that are 8x8 pixels in size. Each image is a handwritten digit in grayscale.
